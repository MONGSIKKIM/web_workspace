            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster
                and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10] Other terms are: Biddy: a
                newly hatched chicken<sup><a href="source.com">[11]</a></sup><sup>[12]</sup> Capon: a castrated or
                neutered male chicken[a] Chick:
                a young chicken[13] Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand,
                informal)[14] Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
                Dunghill
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">fowl</a> a
                chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
                Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the
                poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22
                weeks of age.[18] Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States,
                dialectal)[19] Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and
                Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for
                an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and
                still often in trade and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are
                typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21] In
                Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term
                for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook" or "she keeps chooks"); which
                enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or
                recently hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but
                is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz. the young of any
                bird.

        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
            communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
            Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
            pecking order, with dominant individuals having priority for food access
            and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
            temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
            established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
            can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed] Chickens may
            occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one
            credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a
            chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff up
            its feathers.[35]
